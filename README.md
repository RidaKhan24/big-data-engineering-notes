Hi, I'm Rida

I’m currently learning Big Data Engineering fundamentals and documenting my journey here on GitHub.

📌 What I’m working on:
- Python for data processing
- SQL for analytics & transformations
- Basic ETL pipelines
- Clean, readable documentation

🌱 Goal:
Build strong foundations and transition into a Data Engineering role.

Learning daily. Progress > perfection.
