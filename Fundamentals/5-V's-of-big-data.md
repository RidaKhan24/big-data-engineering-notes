# 5 V's of Big Data

Big Data is defined using five major characteristics known as the 5 V’s.

## 1. Volume

- Refers to the huge amount of data generated  
- Data size can be in terabytes, petabytes, or more  
- Example: Social media posts, logs, videos  

## 2. Velocity

- Speed at which data is generated and processed  
- Real-time or near real-time data flow  
- Example: Live streaming data, stock market data  

## 3. Variety

- Different types of data formats  
- Structured data (tables, databases)  
- Unstructured data (images, videos, text)  
- Semi-structured data (JSON, XML)  

## 4. Veracity

- Refers to the quality and reliability of data  
- Data can be incomplete, noisy, or inaccurate  
- Ensuring clean and trusted data is important  

## 5. Value

- The business usefulness of data  
- Data should generate insights and benefits  
- Without value, data has no purpose  

### Summary

The 5 V’s help to understand why traditional systems cannot handle Big Data and why modern Big Data technologies are required.
